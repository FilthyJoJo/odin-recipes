<p><h3>An Omelette Taco</h3></p>
<p>The Omelette Taco is a simple and easy recipe to learn and can be made with few ingredients.</p>
<p>It can be incredibly filling, calorie friendly, and incredibly delicious with just how much of a blank canvas the combination of eggs and a tortilla wrap provides.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Eggs</li>
    <li>Tortilla Wrap</li>
    <li>Olive Oil or Alternative Such as Butter</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Pepper</li>
    <li>Vegetable or Meat</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat two pans, one for the veggies, meat, and eggs and another for the tortilla wraps</li>
    <li>Add olive oil into the pan and fry vegetables or meat to personal taste.</li>
    <li>While frying, beat a minimum of 1 egg, ideally 2, in a bowl and add salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Add eggs to frying ingredients and allow eggs to cover as much of the surface of the pan as possible.</li>
    <li>On the other pan, place tortilla wrap and flip occasionally as the omelette cooks.</li>
    <li>Once omelette is finished, place atop the tortilla wrap and close, finish cooking tortilla wrap to preferred doneness.</li>
    <li>Immediately begin from step 2 again if making more than one omelette taco.</li>
    <li>Serve on a plate and enjoy with any condiment or sauce you like.</li>
